We present a wearable telepresence system, JackIn Neck, that can be worn on the neck and supports joint activities with a local user, a conversation partner who meet the local user, and a remote user of this system. While previous works demonstrated clear advantages of the neck for the location of wearable devices, a telepresence system tailored for such use had not been developed. JackIn Neck realizes this form factor by combining a camera with a fisheye lens, speakers, and microphones. Because our device is easy to put on and take off, as well as being comfortable to wear, we see the potential of our system to be adopted in the wild, such as sightseeing and event participation remotely.
