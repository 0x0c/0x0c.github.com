Gastroenterological endoscopic surgery needs complex surgical skills such as a sensation of body movement and manipulation of the endoscope that is hard to be explained verbally. Prior research reported that endoscopic surgery is one of the most challenging surgery to teach. Thus, surgeons need long-term practice to master the skills. To support learning such skills, we developed a surgical scene replay system. First, we surveyed 12 surgeons to reveal the reason for the difficulty and elicited three requirements for our system: (1) provide multiple videos that include an endoscope, a fluoroscopy, and hand manipulation for the endoscope to observe the surgery from multiple aspects; (2) visualize an experts' gaze position to understand experts' intention of hand manipulation, and (3) enlarge the size of the gazed video to inform learners where they should pay attention to. Our user study with the system indicates that participants could understand the experts' intentions and tacit knowledge easier than the existing video materials.
