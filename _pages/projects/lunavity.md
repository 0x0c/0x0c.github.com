This paper introduces Augmented Jump, a backpack multirotor system for jumping ability augmentation. Augmented Jump hovers and supports users' weight by a constant upward power of thrust. Users can jump higher and stay in the air for a longer time than usual with Augmented Jump. We designed and developed our first proof-of-concept prototype that can be controlled as an octocopter and support user's weight by 50kg at maximum. In our experiments, it is found that the system enabled the user to perform jumping in simulated 75% reduced gravity. From user study, the results showed that our system was effective for extending the height and the duration of jumping.
